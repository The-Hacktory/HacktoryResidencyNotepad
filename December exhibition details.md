I think I can take 12/13. I am in NY 12/17-19. Can help on the 20th a little. I can maybe take the 12th too, but I'm not sure on that yet.

I can definitely do some sitting - I'll take gap spots or whatever.

I can do some sitting also, esp. towards the later end 12/18-20.

(if we want exhibit to last longer we can have exhibit end later in month instead. my thoughts: no.)

wireless gateway repeater

*   wait, so does this mean there is wifi?

we can go over and test anytime we want.

we could approach a tenant who has better internet and pay them

Lee can bring CLEAR?

we can used wired ethernet

Jacob - wifi/internet person to help me coordinate this?!

Lee suggests we "fake" some of our internet data and have non-internet backup plans!

Instructions for setting up Michael's pieces:

**Elegy For A Home:**

Open the Crane Arts Points Application on the iPhone so that you see the red Start button. Tell the user that this is an audio tour where their location in the gallery space will trigger different sound files. There is a three minute piece of music that is supposed to time out the app when it is finished (this works sometimes and doesn’t work other times). Tell the audience the piece is intended to stop when the music finishes. 

To reset, quit the app by double clicking the home button and sliding the app upward. Reopen to the start button for the next user. This will give everyone a clean beginning if sound is still being played after a use.

The phone cannot be “closed”, meaning you cannot hit the top button while the app is being used, or it will stop. I have it set to never autolock on its own.

**In(determinate) Duet:**

Set up:

Open open TSPS from the dock. In the source tab, make sure Kinect is selected. Navigate to the sensing tab, and to background. Select capture background, making sure no people or objects are inside the rectangle. There doesn’t seem to be a way to save these settings in a reloadable fashion, sorry.

Open Processing, and open Crane Arts A (or B, each computer should run one or the other). run the sketch. try and hit run at the same time on each computer, so they sync. Not imperative, but should be tried for.

Replace the rechargeable batteries into the in ear monitor receivers and put them back in their armbands. remove the turtleshell speakers from their charge cables and turn them on. connect the in ears to the speakers with the 1/8” cable. Turn the volume (the taller knob) on the in ears to about 8 o’clock.

enter the rectangle to make sure the speakers are playing, and each speaker is playing a different sound from the other.

Leave the speakers on the floor to be used. Dim the display of the macbooks so that people don’t watch all the computer stuff.

Use:

Tell the audience these are wearable speakers (and help them wear them) for them to create their own sound and movement piece. Tell them that sounds will change at a given rate due to the location of THEIR BODIES in the rectangle. Their shape does not matter. Flapping their arms will do nothing. Holding the speaker away from them will do nothing. They should just move and react how they see fit.

Shut down:

turn off the speakers and in ears. Return the speakers to their charge cables in the off position. Take the batteries out of the in ears and return them to the charging docks. RIGHT NOW, there is one pack that has normal AA batteries in them from Brookstone. Do not charge those, throw them out. Stop the processing Sketch and quit Processing and open TSPS. Close the computer.
