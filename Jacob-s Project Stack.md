# Jacob's Project Stack

**To Do**

*   Sign up for classes
*   Create Project Stack

*   Do more sketching/prototype drawing

**Things I Want To Learn/Do**

*   Learn how to integrate real-time data (tidal charts, weather, GIS data, sensors, etc) into Processing so it can be visualized as both data and physical motion within a sculpture (activation motors/lights) - _after learning basics of Processing, look into learning Arduino and/or Firmata, which lets you control an arduino board with Processing instead of the Arduino language - Lee 6.18_

Lee - last night you mentioned that Python would be a better language to gather GIS/GPS data.  If I wanted to use this data to then turn a motor in a particular direction - which language would it be best to focus on? 

*   _hey jacob, there are ways to do this to combine python w/ arduino. several of the books we acquired in our library have examples of how to do this. openFrameworks and even Processing can probably do this as well. let's look at the book examples and discuss ways to do this together with 1 or 2 of our expert advisors. i'm now thinking it's time to arrange meeting between you guys and our advisors in early july so everyone can start moving forward on this kind of stuff and get into the nitty gritty details of their projects while improving their coding skills and coming up with project plans. the truth is that you can do almost anything in any language, but each language has its own things it's better at. python is great for working with large amounts of data from the internet. processing is great at making things simple, and making beautiful easy-to-manipulate visualizations. openFrameworks (generally referred to as "oF") is good at working super duper fast and for being able to integrate with tons of other programming languages and on many different kinds of systems and being super modular/customizable. all 3 have communities of artists working in them.-lee 6.19_

Lee - Can we get this book - [Open-Source Lab: How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs](http://www.amazon.com/Open-Source-Lab-Hardware-Reduce-Research/dp/0124104622/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1403291089&sr=8-1&keywords=Open-Source+Lab%3A+How+to+Build+Your+Own+Hardware+and+Reduce+Research+Costs)

*   _-Hey Jacob, short answer: yes, but can it wait one week until Georgia returns from her vacation so I can order it?_
*   Totally cool.
*   Hi there, Jacob I think I can order that book for you. Also, we've been doing some stuff with sensors and gathering data for DMD. One of the guys working on it set up a mini web server using Ruby in the course of a few hours. I think it might be good if you came the next time we worked on that stuff, which should be in the next week or so. I'll copy you on my message to that group if you don't mind.

Please do!

*   Learn how to program small lcd or OLED displays.
*   How to read schematics
*   How to wire circuits correctly (no more melted wires or breadboards!) You should totally come to our Intro to circuits class next week! The content may already be familiar to you, but it would be a great time to start talking with Doug Poole, who is an Electrical Engineer, a great teacher, and is interested in getting involved as a mentor.

Signed up for it!

**Processing HOMEWORK**

I set up the circle to increase in size and change in color as it read the seconds on the computer.  With each mouse click it would show the corresponding seconds, shifting over as time increased.

  I couldn't quite figure out how to switch between the two (image and text) - so that clicking would clear the screen and just show seconds, or just show the visualization of time passing.

*     _-hey jacob : question? i tried running your could and it hit me back with a **"cannot convert from void to int" _**_Is there a library i should import? or a piece of code im missing?_
*   -_this happened to me too. _

hmm, I just retried it in here - [](http://semmy.me/ide/)http://semmy.me/ide/ and it worked, so not totally sure.  - maybe double checking that the last two "}" are there.

*   -_hmmmmmm. runs fine on the processing.js site. What is the processing.js website in the first place? is it an online environment to run and compile processing? im suspecting that it has libraries of it very own and maybe that would explain why it wouldnt run on my  Laptop based Processing environment... **<u>LEE??????????????????</u>_**

*   _-Processing.js is a JavaScript port of Processing. There are some significant differences and you should read about them [here](http://www.aosabook.org/en/pjs.html)._

**Questions To Ponder**

*   Was this easy/hard?

Easy

*   What was the point of the Angry Birds code tutorial?

Getting us to understand that what we want to have happen in a program is broken down into simple steps.  Also the direct relationship between code/language/what-goes-on-behind-the-bird/input and output/visualization.

*   Were you surprised by how quickly you made something in Processing?

Yes (but I've also done a little of this before)! 

*   What do you like about coding in Processing? What do you find difficult?

I love that it can transform images, break them down and build them up again.  

The math is difficult ... and - for() loops always get me when writing them

*

**Project for July**

What I would like to do is to update a version of this project on a smaller scale: 

[](http://www.jacobrivkin.com/work/catenary-for-aeolus/)http://www.jacobrivkin.com/work/catenary-for-aeolus/

I used an Arduino to turn off and on a vacuum motor and fan motor, which were connected via a large light-plastic form, to look like they were breathing.  The pattern was based on video I shot in Newfoundland and the ebb and flow of the tide coming in.  I timed when each one went in and out and created a case system in the .ide to run the program (I can post that code later).  What I really want to learn is how to actually synchronize this "ebb and flow"  with real-time data from the interwebs.  

So - this means I need to:

*   Learn API!!!!
*   Get a new Arduino (Lee do we have any we can use?) 
*   Get a WiFi Shield for Arduino
*   Get another vacuum and fan motor
*   Get a relay shield (Do we have any at the Hacktory?)

*   _if your broke i can show you how to make an up to 8+ output relay setup using standard relays from radio shack, some resistors, blowback diodes, and a couple of registers. (i use the same set up to control all my animatronics) If the aurdino board you are using has enough digital and/ or analog outputs for the number of motors you are trying to control then we dont need the shift register / demux (DE-MULTIPLEXER ) , but im sure at some point you will want to control more then the outputs provided so if your down,  i would be interested in learning what code is needed to send what i would imagine would be clock data on one output and serial data on the other to a demux chip (takes the one stream and turns it into many streams) to control all those motors. - max_
*   I would love to learn how to make them in-house regardless of cost.  What was interesting about the code I was using for the fan and the motor was that I brought them in as analog inputs - which meant I could control their respective speeds using 0-255.  The vacuum was crazy fast regardless so I kept it at 1.  But it was interesting to be able to control the speeds with the Arduino.
*   _PS what kind of motors are you trying to control? Let me know the AMP rating so i can help you figure out the type of relays. Also, have you played with SERVOS (unlike standard motors, servo motion can be controlled by very tiny increments as well as change direction) eat all? I know that arduino is really great at sending and controlling seRvoS (camel humping!)_
*   Stepper motors - I think I would go for ones that use the lowest amount of energy/amp possible.  The weight load won't  be very much since it will be positioned vertically.

 ![](https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_U6S0z289e3C_p.188779_1403800214577_Screen shot 2014-06-26 at 12.29.55 PM.png)

I've used servo motors before.  I built a shovel that closed up on itself when it got dark out (lightsensor -> servo control).  It kind of worked.  The servo motor wasn't exactly strong enough to lift the shovel head - and it kind of bounced around then I think broke a few of the teeth in the servo ... I have pics of it somewhere - I'll find em soon and post it.   

If this isn't doable on a month scale (I think it totally is) - the other option is to build a sensor that can monitor real-time data.  I could build a sensor to put by the piers by Bartram's Garden to measure tide or wind speed, and have that data then do "X".  Another part of this could be to learn how to use that data it collects to then be broadcast via WiFi ([](http://www.flutterwireless.com/))http://www.flutterwireless.com/) which then shows a visualization on a screen nearby.

*   Get a new Arduino
*   Get a wifi shield
*   Build a sensor
*   Learn how to broadcast the data collected (I'm guessing  the data is sent to the serial port, and that is what is broadcast?)
*   Design visualization to represent what happens when data is collected
*   Figure out solar input - I've been looking at these: [](http://www.rei.com/product/836250/goal-zero-boulder-15-solar-panel#reviewsTab)http://www.rei.com/product/836250/goal-zero-boulder-15-solar-panel#reviewsTab to contemplate if there is a way to make the sensor self-sustaining.

Also - Learn how to access this biz.

TREE ANTENNAS?!

_super useful - ml_

What about making circuits that "grow" and "change" based on biological and chemical environmental reactions??? Like electro-conductive molds? Do those exist? i guess thats how shit works any ways but it would be fun to make a moldy bread circuit that was powered by decomposing lemons and powers the butt end of fireflies ....

WIND CODE

This code works to get the windspeed data from the Wunderground API onto the Arduino using the WifiShield (Arduino brand) and prints it to the Serial Monitor - <s>the one thing I'm having trouble with is getting the wind_mph to be an integer.  I've tried using toInt() and atoi() ...but to no avail...</s>

Got it working!!  With Tim's help - I was able to convert the string to a string of characters, and then replace the ">" with a "".  Now it's an integer I can use as an input to map the speed to the fan motor.

<s>I was having one slight issue with the WUnderground API blocking my request, but I changed the server from: </s>

<s>char server[] = "api.wunderground.com";   </s>

<s>to:</s>

<s>IPAddress server (38,102,136,138);</s>

<s>I'm still having some server issues - not sure what's up with it.  I emailed with the folks at the wunderground and they said it's not on their end. so I dont know.</s>

IT WORKS IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!

I had read that the Arduino isn't great at supplying power to motors, but actually learning this now through experience where I can only get my fan to make a pathetic "whrrrrrrrr".   Max helped me come up with a schematic to use an external power supply, some transistors, diodes, and resistors to create a better, more well powered connection.  

These online sources were also helpful in figuring out the parts I needed as well.

**Python Beautiful Soup/Parsing**

Still trying to do the meteor/fireball project of scraping the site using Python.  Last night I got python on my computer and was able to download all the links to a text file - now I need to figure out how to download all the links as movie files - with the further intention of using RazPi and a small monitor in a sculpture.  Resources on this are quite scarce (lame).  

For future reference - here's a lot of links that talk about it:

*   **CODE**

Okey dokey - this script from Python gets the links to all of the .avi files from the desired webpage and writes them to a text file.

Things to figure out

*   how to download [avi] files

*   how to write the code so that it updates the webpage each day (webpage follows a year/month/day protocol - when its not 2AM I can figure this out

*   how to use either processing or razPi to compile videos into one

*   how to link this with razPi and send to a video screen

This code now uses the current date (since the webpage is updated daily based on the date) to scrape the links for all the files and then downloads them to the hard-drive and combines all the files into one .avi file which is then run through Processing to do this....

David helped me do the coding for piping in FFMPEG (video streamer) to do combining of the videos.  That jumped me forward about two weeks in the process.  THANK YOU SENSOR TEAM!

Next steps - learn how to automate this process and import everything to a raspberry pi and my website.

**Mountain Water Compass **

I got the first section of code that I need working.  It measures the distance between two coordinates and returns a value in KM, and the cardinal direction needed to travel to that point.

The cardinal direction piece will help influence the servo motor in which direction it needs to turn.

Next steps are learning how to parse a csv file with arduino so I can have the program return the closest body of water and closest mountain.

**GPS Distance to Mountain Parser**

The code for this part is working.  It compares a list of coordinates to your relative position and gives you the closest one back.  This current list only has three.  Next step after this: Figuring out north with a compass and turning stepper motors to the correct position based on the cardinal direction provided....

**COMPASS/Stepper Motor Set**

hey jacob, you need to start posting your stuff to github! :) -Lee

I will once all the code is finished!

**Complete code for "Compass for mountain and water code"**

Still a little in shock that this works.  

Compiles to:  Binary sketch size: 21,878 bytes (of a 32,256 byte maximum)

I might try to add in more data points, maybe top 50 largest bodies of water and highest points so it is a more robust work.
