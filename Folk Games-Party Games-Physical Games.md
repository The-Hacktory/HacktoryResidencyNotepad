# Folk Games/Party Games/Physical Games

_I'm starting a list for Marcel of folk games/party games to be playtested.-Lee_

**[Uroos Maluroos](http://auntiepixelante.com/?p=2162) (the murderers)**

by Anna Anthropy 

*   This is a note-passing murder game for parties. Rules are written on the note that gets passed around unobtrusively so that the "target" person doesn't notice. If 4 different murder weapons are drawn on the note and then it's passed to the target, they are assassinated. If target sees the note before this occurs, the assassination has been foiled.

**[Drunk Dungeon](http://kotaku.com/5913389/for-one-night-only-a-game-you-need-to-get-drunk-to-play) **

by Margaret Robinson

*   Hide and Seek, the company that created the party game for the NYU Game Center for an event called “No Quarter”, describes the game[ in a recent blog post](http://www.hideandseek.net/2012/05/23/drunk-dungeon-the-making-of/) as “coasters + player-made dungeon + party**“**. Basically, the idea is that each time a person at the party gets a drink, they also get a coaster with [a picture of a dungeon tile on it](http://www.hideandseek.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/dd_drying_orange_maps.jpg), The full rules are very short,[ just at one page](http://www.hideandseek.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/dd_flier_rules.pdf), Which is probably best considering it is a game that was designed to be played by people that have the potential to be inebriated

**[B.U.T.T.O.N.](http://brutallyunfairtactics.com/) (Brutally Unfair Tacticts Totally Okay Now)**

by Copenhagen Game Collective

*   B.U.T.T.O.N. is a physical party game for 2-8 players. Race to your controller through physical space, and do whatever it takes to win (or to avoid losing). Act like a monkey, jump up and down, wrestle over the controllers, strip off some clothing, cheat your competitors, and above all, expect the unexpected. Brutally unfair tactics are, after all, totally OK now!

**[Johan Sebastian Joust](http://jsjoust.com/)**

by Die Gute Fabrik

*   _Johann Sebastian Joust_ is a no-graphics, digitally-enabled playground game designed for motion controllers. The goal is to be the last player remaining. When the music — J.S. Bach's ‌Brandenburg Concertos — plays in slow-motion, the controllers are very sensitive to movement. When the music speeds up, the threshold becomes less strict, giving the players a small window to dash at their opponents. If your controller is ever moved beyond the allowable threshold, you're out! Try to jostle your opponents' controllers while protecting your own.

**[Standoff](http://gutefabrik.com/blog/?p=2041)**

by Die Gute Fabrik

*   This game is played in a series of rounds. Players pantomine shooting themselves, shooting another player, or shooting into the air with their imaginary hand guns. Depending on the interaction between players shooting themselves or others, some players will die between rounds. Game proceeds until 1 person is left standing or everyone is dead.
