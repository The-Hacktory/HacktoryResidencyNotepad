I like the photo caption: Susie Lee has been sitting through a lot of business meetings.

..."Her "studio" is meetings. Meetings with other startup entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, in cafes, or at "meetups" and conferences, sometimes even over whiskey and cigars in penthouse clubs in skyscrapers. To network, she's had to learn the favored terms of the tech startup world: "pivot," "innovation," "biz dev," "repeatable and scalable." Her "smock" is a T-shirt she had mass-produced and that she wears around town that says: "Siren: Charm Someone's Pants Off."...

..."She's currently in the running for a significant art grant, but keeps waiting for the art world to say, "This is not an art project," she says. Will she be cut off and kicked out by the art world?

"At the same time, I'm an artist, I'm always supposed to challenge the judge," she says. "The soul of the artist—we think of it as tortured or connecting with the sublime, but maybe the actual soul shares more sensibility with a prisoner looking for escape routes and hustlers trying to cobble things together and then running away. How you begin to escape those bonds of establishment, in whatever way you do it—that is where the art lies, and when the establishment comes, you keep running away." ...

_This part is interesting_

..."But Siren is based on the existing dynamics of desire and gender online; Siren is more about control. It fits the terms of the recently written Pugetopolis Manifesto, written by Seattle artist Meghan Trainor and posted at [medium.com](http://medium.com/), calling for the Northwest to become a center for "Liberation Technology." The Northwest is a center for "artists working with and about technology," and along with the rest of "the Philosophy wing of the Seattle Art & Technology Workshop," "we observe that technology spaces are increasingly homogenous... We declare that homogeneity begets homogeneity" and "That people unlike you may be missing from your spaces for reasons that _you_ need to fix." ...

..."Siren could have been a little web site that I put on a gallery wall, and we talk about how horrible these [mainstream] sites are," Lee says. Digital artists who clamor to get into museums are missing "the power of what digital art can do. Digital art has a huge audience, and it's on 24/7." ...

..."The business world is "ruthless but clear," Lee says. She finds it more supportive than the art world. "There's a culture of scarcity and fear in the art world that tears it apart," she says. "When you think there is a small pie and only so many opportunities, then you hoard... The gatekeepers become prophets of culture, taste, and conversation... You begin to hear yourself resent others, and you feel impoverished, even if not financially, then certainly as a citizen that often feels like it has no real function except to be at the whim of some courtly upper class." ...

Also, side note: getting press like this is possible for all of you - I can help with that ;-)
