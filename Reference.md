These are great! The same stuff we're going to cover next week in our intro to circuits class. I'll be doing some of the basic stuff, and my co-teacher Doug will be showing some sample experiments and getting into more advanced stuff. Doug works as an electrical engineer now and used to fix old pinball boards as a kid.
