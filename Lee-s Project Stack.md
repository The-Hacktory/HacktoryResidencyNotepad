# Lee's Project Stack

**I'd like each artist-in-resident to have a page like this where they can take notes, ask questions, track their progress, etc. This is one way we can share what we're working on even when we're not in the same space.**

**To Do**

*   put bios online
*   look into studio space for residents - ekg?
*   schedule safety training for residents with Mike
*   find a teacher and schedule a gitHub training

*   schedule an Intro to API/wrangle the web class for fall - IFTT and temboo-focused

**Notes**

*   Ask residents to write a blog post after our June sessions summarizing what they've learned and what they're going to explore
*   Work with residents to figure out how we can make this learning more collaborative. What are the best ways we can share what we're doing?
*   Goal: to have residents become teachers, bring more people into the community interested in working with art and technology

_Why am I reading about this? I am building my own digital camera with an Arduino and an external display that snap together. Arduino is a different language/framework, influenced by Processing but built on top of the C++ programming language. Processing makes it easy to draw a line since it's a programming language for making visual/generative art - for example: line(x1, y1, x2, y2); - but Arduino doesn't have a built-in tool to draw or make visual art. Processing has the algorithm to draw a line between 2 points built in, but I have to put the code inside my camera from scratch. I did a search online to see if that already existed and found that pretty much all programming languages use the following system to draw lines on a screen:_

[Bresenham's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_algorithm) - wikipedia entry.

The **Bresenham line algorithm** is an algorithm that determines which points in an _n_-dimensional raster should be plotted in order to form a close approximation to a straight line between two given points. It is commonly used to draw lines on a computer screen, as it uses only integer addition, subtraction and bit shifting, all of which are very cheap operations in standard computer architectures. It is one of the earliest algorithms developed in the field of computer graphics. A minor extension to the original algorithm also deals with drawing circles.

**Physical Apps idea**

"non-technology" technology

physical versions of apps

e.g. what is a "weather app" in the real world? what is a communication app?

Is there a way to represent these visually? does this look like a book? small like a phone? pocketable?
