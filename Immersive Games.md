**Elements of a game**

*   rules
*   mechanics
*   objectivest

*   obstacles (challenges to keep player interested)

**Games to try tonight**

Theme: Games that provoke IRL interaction

*   Heads Up
*   XMPLAR
*   Spaceteam

**Participatory Dance as a Game**

*   Immersive gaming is synonymous with participatory dance/theater
*   There are rules, mechanics, feedback loop, obstacles, "leveling up"
*   The only difference is that there is an interaction with the real world around you in real time. This is what makes it an _immersive game_
*   What if we took these elements of gaming and subversively (?) integrated into civic engagement
*   GPS Bodies - Developed with the Attic Youth Center
*   challenge: to make a game fun if you have a social focus/interest

**Feedback Loop**

*   feedback on where you are/how you are doing. 
*   feedback on your progress

XMPLAR Game

*   critique: game doesn't have a longterm goal/payoff
*   more of an "interactive experience" than a fun game

Spaceteam Game

*   multiplayer game where players yell instructions to each other
*   feedback on how well you are doing individually/collaboratively

Good/fun games are simple, seem to be able to work whether they were tech enabled or not
