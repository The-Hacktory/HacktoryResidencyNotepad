# Sensors Team

One of the grants Dept. of Making + Doing won is from ArtPlace America, so for our version of "placemaking" we are going to build sensors and try to map whatever we can sense in the vicinity, and hopefully use it to engage those in our community.

I'm posting here because Jacob and Max came to our last meeting, and we had a great time talking about potential sensors.

This work is relevant to all of you because it **could be a way to get parts that you could repurpose for your projects! **The ArtPlace project ends in November, and after that I'm not sure what we would do with the parts. I have a substantial budget to buy supplies, including Raspberri Pi's, cameras, extra shields and add-ons for these boards. Whatever you build would have to be for the ArtPlace project first, but it's very experimental so there's lots of room to just try things out.

As we said last night our next meeting for this group is **next Wednesday, August 6 at 7 pm.**

Here's info on the projects we are doing already:

And for Max and Jacob, about the rfid sensing, here's some commentary from the guys who did the wifi sensing, about projects that were inspired by their work.

Hi Peoples of Senses! My buddy Jay set up one of the RaspPeyes with a monitor and wireless - 

!!!!!!! He tried to attach the camera to the PI and he couldnt get it to work. From what he could tell with researching it on the web, the camera itself might actually be defective :(
