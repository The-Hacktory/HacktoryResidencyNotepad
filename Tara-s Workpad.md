**Project path - July/August**
<ul class="taskdone"><li><s>Keep learning processing</s>, start looking at Arduino language (in class 8/5-8/19)<ul class="taskdone"><li>Ask about supplies and breadboard</li>

*    [Georgia](/ep/profile/xNudWl91SoT) - where do we make requests for circuitry or other things like books we might need? 

*   _hey tara, email these to us or post to the ordering page-lee_
*   Yes, if you can add them to the ordering page that would be best. It will be helpful for me if we track all purchases in one place.
<ul class="taskdone"><li>get multimeter working - need 9V</li></ul class="taskdone">
</li></ul class="taskdone">
</li>
<li><s>See if old Arduino works and build something blinky blinky or motion sensitive for end of August</s></li>
<li>Start looking at GPS Arduinos</li>

*   -- Tara--keep me posted on how this develops for you. I'm thinking about possibly integrating gps and arduino.... 
*   ok - will do
</ul class="comment">

*   UPDATE 8/5 - hope to use GPS arduino for August/September project

*   Look into Web APIs

**SEPTEMBER Project**

I've been thinking about this Figure Running forum that someone  showed me (also that runner that's been drawing penises with Nike+) and  using GPS data to 'draw' things in processing. 

And then I did a little research: [](http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/project.cfm?id=290)[http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/project.cfm?id=290](http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/project.cfm?id=290)

Workflow: 

*   test GPS data with processing

*   use codebender to code adafruit

*   working on coding in processing

*   argh. Got the connexion to work at home but Dmd laptops giving me "error serial port: busy port fail"
<ul class="taskdone"><li>create Processing code using data and look for interactive moments

*   research other projects
*   [](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/connecting-arduino-to-processing)https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/connecting-arduino-to-processing

*   investigate using night sky or URL along with keypress code
</ul class="task">

*   Project on something

Tara, I'd love to check out your GPS device when you get it the way you want it. I think I will be at DM+D Wed afternoon.

[michaelkiley215@gmail.com](/ep/profile/D4JygV1Cg4G) let me know when you're going to be around!  I'll show it to you. I'm not getting messages from this page for some reason unless I look.  Last night I couldn't get it to work on the DMD computers, though.  Just at home.

PROCESSING CODE - arduino to processing 'radar' looking data 

Serial myPort; //create new sketch 

float val; //data from Arduino

float angle;

float radius;

void setup ()

{

size(500, 500);

frameRate(30);

strokeWeight(2);

smooth();

String portName = Serial.list()[0];//match number to port

myPort = new Serial (this, portName, 9600);

background (0);

for(int y = 20; y <=height -20; y+=10) {

  for (int x = 20; x<=width-20; x+=10) {

    ellipse(x, y, 4, 4);

  }

}

}

void draw()

{

  if(myPort.available() > 0)

  { //if data is available

  val = myPort.read();

  radius = map(val, 0, 255, 0, height * .45);  

 println(val);

int middleX = width/2;

int middleY = height/2;

float x = middleX + cos(angle)*height/2;

float y = middleY + sin(angle)*height/2;

stroke(0);

line(middleX, middleY, x, y);

x= middleX + cos(angle)*radius;

y= middleY + sin(angle)*radius;

angle += 0.01;

stroke(255);

line(middleX, middleY, x, y);

}

}

______________

I started a Pinterest board looking at some of the things I'm currently inspired by or obsessed with - of course, I have other boards on there as well, if you care to follow my current delving into the homemade popsicle trend.  For this board, these images tend towards fashion-oriented, which isn't my main focus/interest, but it is a starting point for the design process and current obsessions.  I will also have a Dropbox and Instagram as we move along, I suspect.

_notes from Georgia 6/11:_
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>Cool Tara! You should check out the work of Leslie Birch, who was just featured as this week's "Geek of the Week"</li>
<li>[](http://www.geekadelphia.com/2014/06/11/geek-of-the-week-local-maker-leslie-birch/)http://www.geekadelphia.com/2014/06/11/geek-of-the-week-local-maker-leslie-birch/</li>
<li>She's been a long time supporter and one of the original "organizers" of The Hacktory. I'm happy to put you in touch with her soon too.</li>

*   Georgia  I would love to talk to Leslie!  
</ul class="comment">

*   UPDATE 7/30: We have a meeting scheduled for Friday 8/1/14 at 12noon at the Hacktory!

*   UPDATE 8/5: Great meeting with Leslie, she and I have similar backgrounds.  She also gave me some great materials tips for wearables and we talked about future projects.  We are now sharing info via gmail on projects.  One of the cool things we're talking about is the conductivity of plant matter - specifically moss.

_notes from Lee 6/13:_

*   Lots of resources for wearables on Adafruit's wearables page [here](https://www.adafruit.com/category/65).

In particular, a lot of DIY wearables online tells you how to make stuff that blinks. With some relatively easy alterations of code, we can make these things send messages, make sounds, create graphics in a projection, etc. [Here's](https://learn.adafruit.com/flora-gps-jacket) a project to check out that we could modify/build into something else. 

*   I'm excited to see how these work.  One of the things I don't like about wearables for performance is the switching on and off part, which can be clunky or awkward, but I've seen some cool ideas with smartphone activated apps.  So, yea, the kit, I bought ages ago and still have is this: [](http://www.instructables.com/id/turn-signal-biking-jacket/)http://www.instructables.com/id/turn-signal-biking-jacket/[ ](http://www.instructables.com/id/turn-signal-biking-jacket/)

*   Your project path simplified may look like this: 1. Learn intro to coding in Processing and then start hacking around with simple Arduino projects to blink LEDs 2. Try building the Adafruit GPS project or similar and look for ways to modify it 3. Learn about Web APIs and start by exploring [If This Then That](https://ifttt.com) or Temboo libraries and explore Intro To Social Hacking (a class/curriculum we'll review later in the summer) 4. Build your custom project
