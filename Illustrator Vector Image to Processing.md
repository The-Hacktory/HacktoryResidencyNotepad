# Illustrator Vector Image to Processing

Hey yall found this really useful plug-in for exporting drawings from illustrator into code for use in Processing. Unfortunately, it doesnt seem work with my current version of the software because im an asshole and decided to actually pay Adobe a yearly CLOUD membership fee and, of course , the newest version doesnt work with the plug in :-(

*   cool - I'll che2ck it out, I have several versions to play with at work via Swarthmore's IT.

They have the CS6 illustrator on the comps at the Hacktory - so you should be able to use it there.
