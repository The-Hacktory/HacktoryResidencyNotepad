# Marcel's Hackpad!

Oh hey. Looking forward to using this awesome mechanism. Here are my goals:

*   Set a date for Game Night
*   Look and schedule what Hacktory classes I will be attending this summer

*   Clarify what GPSBodies "Phase II" goals are as I anticipate this will be what I show for the hacktory's exhibition

*   Clarify the wealth of various tools that I can learn during my Hacktory residency and hone-in on skills that are relevant to my future goals and what can make me money

cool ok game I mentioned 7/8.  -tara

Thank you [webb.tnd@gmail.com](/ep/profile/sF1Ux58CCJA). This is gorgeous. It reminds me a lot of another game that I'll need to search and find... 

_notes from Lee 6/11:_

*   Marcel - you in particular may benefit from checking out other people's performance/choreography/immersive installations and then we break down the underlying structures that allow them to happen. What is the code? what are the physical sensors/computers doing the work? Exploring the intersection of choreography (a script for a person) and code scripts (for objects - maybe for people too)
*   things worth exploring: Intro to Processing, Using a Kinect (in Procesing or...), 
*   Some fun Processing-coded projects you may like are below:

Cool project by Chris Sugrue [](http://csugrue.com/delicateboundaries/)http://csugrue.com/delicateboundaries/ I'm not sure if that's Processing or OpenFrameworks

These are great [lee t](/ep/profile/wVl2KVvy64z) --the petting zoo reminds me quite a bit of what I worked on with the Immersive Kinematics lab with UPenn and it's always amazing to see the kinds of projection animations folks can create with processing. You mentioned a GPS-based coding workshop. When might that be happening? I think it'll be pretty critical to the project I'm developing.
