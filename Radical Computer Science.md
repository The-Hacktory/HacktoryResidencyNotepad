*   Thinking about language design as a creative practice. 
*   code allows us to execute post human thoughts
*   ways of thinking that go beyond thinking as a human
*   code is a thought amplification device
*   this is structured by languages which are all human made, negotiated, a series of decisions.

*   think about what you think the person who wrote the language thought was important when they designed the language?
*   this is context dependent. C is from the 1960s, very different context to how we use it now.
*   No strings in C, difficult dealing with text. 
*   Question: if you have code and say it does something, how do you prove that it does that?

        *   eg. code managing a pace maker this is important
    *   code for video games, not such a big deal, malfunctions are opportunities. Often right and wrong is arbitrary.
    *   Next week: turing model computation

*   Code is like archeology. You are building on code that someone wrote (ususally in the mid 80s).
*   When you build a motorcycle, all parts are new rebuilt etc etc. We don't use parts from the 60s. 
*   We don't have the luxury with software dev.
*   Build on UNIX - you have an internet stack, audio stack, all this work build already. A PROFOUND amount of work. Build from scratch you have nothing.
*   Commodore 64 would boot into a basic prompt. Boot up interaction is a command line prompt. First interaction is that you have to write a command.
*   GateKeeper MaxOS (new feature in macOS) Won't let you run code unless it is from the app store. The error message is 'this app is corrupt and you should throw it away'. Now the basic way you talk to computers is by consumption (buying code), rather than creation as in (commodor 64). A BIG SHIFT! 

**Homework**

*   Pick an image from great art bot. And then generate a programming language (textural) that could generate this. Pick one image and go on a journey on how you might make it. Set of descriptions is enough. [](https://twitter.com/greatartbot)[https://twitter.com/greatartbot](https://twitter.com/greatartbot)
