# Homework 1

_Please document these on your project pages!_

**Things to Watch and Do**

*   Do an introduction to code [here ](http://code.org/learn)using Angry Birds.  Click on the one with Mark Zuckerberg's head on it. Get bored by this tutorial? Stop and proceed to next step.
*   Do the 1-hour [tutorial](http://hello.processing.org/) of learning to program in Processing! This is my favorite coding tutorial ever!

*   Show and Tell! Take a screenshot of something you've created in Processing (even during the tutorial). How to take a screenshot? Press Command + Shift + 3 and then release all keys. It will save the file to your desktop. Add that image to your project page on hackpad. Copy and paste your code for that image below the screenshot.

*   OPTIONAL: 40 minute [video](http://vimeo.com/45851523) of a talk by Casey Reas (one of the inventors of Processing) talking about making art with code and chance operations. It's sort of a talk about the artistic lineage to creating an artist's programming language.

**Questions To Ponder**

*   Was this easy/hard?
*   What was the point of the Angry Birds code tutorial?
*   Were you surprised by how quickly you made something in Processing?
*   What do you like about coding in Processing? What do you find difficult?

**Make a list of questions and/or things you want to learn!: Marcel**

*   Attend all of Tim Bieniosek's courses in July
*   [lee t: Is Processing the best coding choice for these related goals listed here? In particular, we need to make sure that I'm using a coding program that is location-based and connected to game playing. Let me know your thoughts](/ep/profile/wVl2KVvy64z)

_Marcel - to be truthful here, Processing can work (and is a great 1st programming language and could do this work), but I don't know many examples of exactly such a game/application being created with Processing. I think you'd probably want to use an Arduino with a GPS shield and an application built with something (Processing, OpenFrameworks, or Python actually might work well). At the end of the day, you just have to pick one. One of the things I've been trying to emphasize is that in technology you can't necessarily jump in and do the big thing right away. You need your training wheels first. I believe you should make something smaller this month (that's your July homework) that does a little bit of what you want. From that first case I think you will have answers as to how you want to proceed afterwards. I only emphasize processing because learning that language is much easier than any other, and has lots of uses, and the learning can then be put into other languages/applications later. Examples of good first projects would be to build a Wearable GPS thing (in arduino. see _[here](https://learn.adafruit.com/flora-wearable-gps/overview)_.) or build something to track your mileage, a small arduino that tweets your location on your bike, etc etc._

Thanks Lee. I will definitely plan on learning processing. Don suggested that the "only" program is Unity 3D but since I've never coded before and access to Unity 3D is shaky best to get familiar with the process :-) 

-I'm confused why he suggested Unity 3D. That's for making a 3D videogame for a mac, pc, xbox, playstation, etc. It is THE standard for making a game with 3d graphics, so if that's your goal, yes, learn it. I took this 1month online [course](http://www.onemonthgameschool.com/class/introduction-to-unity-and-playmaker/) and enjoyed it.

Megan am but a guiltless messenger Lee. But his impression was that for an interactive app that's accessible for androids and ios unity 3d is the only option. I 

*   Meet with Lee to identify a doable processing goal that's integrated with Tim's courses as well as the timeline for the GPSB project
*   Create the July Goal
*   Fulfill the July Goal. Aww yeeeah
