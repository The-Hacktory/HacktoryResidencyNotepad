# Tara's Final Project - How to

Running TSPS in the gallery with Processing.

I exported Processing to an application file called "Bowler_Trails" on the desktop.

1.  Open TSPS - this will engage Kinect - there's a calibration image on the desktop. It's stored as a TIFF file.

1.  Open Bowler_Trails app - should automatically run to the projector.

1.  Turn switches on lights for the Hat hanging on the wall.
2.  Turn switches on steady (3 clicks) for el-wire on floor next to plug strip where Kinect/Computer plugged in.
3.  Turn switch on light up tiara.

El-wire, tiara, and light up hat run on batteries.  Might need replacing before the run is out.
