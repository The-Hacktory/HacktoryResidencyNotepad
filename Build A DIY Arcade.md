# Build A DIY Arcade

From [Build a DIY Arcade](http://babycastles.com/website/science-gallery-how-to-babycastles/) with Babycastles workshop

_"In this workshop, we combine independent games from local game developers, large stuffed animals, chef knives, colorful duct tape, assorted blinking electronics, and the virus-writing windows scripting software “AutoHotkey”, amongst other things, and emerged with a new independent video games arcade exhibited to the public as part of GAME, an exhibition exploring the future of play, at Science Gallery."_

**Scripting a Button Controller (with AutoHotKey)**

-virus writing software

-only on PC (though there's similar software on Mac like ControllerMate)

-re-used instead as simple scripting (like python or javascript) language to re-map keyboard buttons 

-used to autolaunch a video game on a windows computer, not on Mac :( and to map keyboard buttons

**Make an Arcade Button**

by breaking apart a computer mouse and soldering an arcade button to it

-smash open a mouse (brute force)

-identify the switch above the left click and the right click (each mouse is slightly different, but it's not rocket science!)

-use 2 wires. strip a few inches of shielding off the ends of both wires.

-there should be two tabs on the bottom of your arcade button (if there are more, you may have to play around).

-solder a wire to each tab on your arcade button. solder the the other ends of the wire to each spot on the left mouse click.

_Thumb pointing to the three pins of the left click button. Solder one strip of wire to the middle pin for the left click. Solder another wire to one of the other pins, either to the left or right of that center one. If it doesn't work, pull off the wire (de-solder) and solder it to the pin on the other side. _

_This shows soldering to both the left click and the right click of the mouse._

**Test your button**

-Open up Canabalt or other game, and test to see that your button works

-If not, test your broken mouse's other buttons to see if you can figure out where you need to connect your wires

_Note: Alternative to taking apart a mouse is buying a $50 [MakeyMakey](http://makeymakey.com/), which lets you make a lot of buttons (for games that need many more buttons)_

**More Creative Buttons**

-You can make a button out of almost anything. Gloves, sandals, slapping something, ANYTHING as long as you can complete a circuit

-Use aluminum foil or conductive foil tape to make a switch

-we used stuffed animals and conductive tape connected to our mouse switches to make 3 button games
