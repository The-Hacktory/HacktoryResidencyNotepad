# Recommendations for Robert

Let's start a list of things we think our first Fellow Robert Spahr might want to check out!

This could be locations with live video feeds that could make interesting juxtapositions for his work, or just other interesting places or art in Philly.

I made a map in google where we can add pins and notes to the locations:

_-Hey [Georgia](/ep/profile/xNudWl91SoT), make sure you add me too! It says I don't have permissions to access the map!_

Whoopsy - just changed that. Still very confusing in google how to let people edit and not just read.

Thanks for adding more places everyone! I just sent it to Robert.

To add a place with notes on the map: type in the location and it should place a green pointer on the map. Select the pointer and click "save to map." It should then turn red. You can then select it again and click the icon to edit, and change the name and add a note.
