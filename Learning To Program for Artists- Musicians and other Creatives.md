# Learning To Program for Artists, Musicians and other Creatives

_some parts adapted from curriculum at the School For Poetic Computation_

**Who is this for?**

For anyone curious about programming

For anyone looking to express themselves in a new medium

So that participants can have a conceptual model of what programming is good for.

**What are the end goals?**

Artists feel confident to break things

Artists are excited (instead of scared) to learn new tools, features, libraries and languages

Artists know they have the support of a huge community, and how to tap into that support

Artists always think 'I can do this' even if they don't know exactly how

**Method**

1.  Show inspiration of what can be done with programming, to open possibilities
2.  Start by disarming students fears by playing a game without computers
3.  Pick an environment that is easy to setup, has a limited vocabulary, and immediate visual feedback

**Icebreaker**

1.  Split into Pairs
2.  Write instructions for a blind robot rover to get from front door to podium or seat.
3.  Run code!
4.  Place obstacles in path. Modify code to include a function to deal with obstruction.

**What Is A Programming Language?**

A programming language is a constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms (step by step procedures). The earliest programming languages preceded the invention of the computer, and were used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms and player pianos. 

Programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater degree of precision and completeness. When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers "do exactly what they are told to do", and cannot "understand" what code the programmer intended to write.  --_ [wikipedia article ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)on programming language history_

**Programming as Instructions**

A computer program in the form of a human-readable, computer programming language is called source code. 

_Children's Activity / Pre-Computer Programming_

*   1. We want to tell the turtle how to make a circle for us on the screen. First watch while I pretend I am the turtle and I am going to walk out a circle. I begin to take a step and then turn a little. I continue these two moves until a circle is beginning to form. As I make each movement I am talking out loud and naming each move. I step then turn, then step, then turn, etc. I continue this process until I end up in the same spot I started in.
*   2. Now I want you to stand up and we will all pretend to be turtles. Let's all begin making a circle in slow motion by taking one step then a little turn. Keep doing this and name each move as you take it. Keep going until you end up where you started from.
*   3. Pair off children for the purpose of more practice. Each child will take a turn at being the turtle and the commander for walking and talking out of a circle.
*   4. Now let's see how you would make a smaller circle. Walk it out. Which move changed: the step or the turn? That's right, if you make a sharper turn your circle will become tighter or smaller

**Basic Parts of a Programming Language**

Programming is somewhat like working with building blocks. Given enough children's toy blocks (and enough time and ingenuity), you can build just about anything with only a few kinds of blocks. 

*   **input**: getting data and commands into the computer (variables)
*   **output**: getting your results out of the computer
*   **arithmetic**: performing mathematical calculations on your data
*   **procedures or functions**
*   **conditional**: testing to see if a condition is true or false
*   **looping**: cycling through a set of instructions until some condition is met

**Hello World**

A "Hello World" program has become the traditional first program that many people learn. In general, it is simple enough so that people who have no experience with computer programming can easily understand it, especially with the guidance of a teacher or a written guide. Using this simple program as a basis, computer science principles or elements of a specific programming language can be explained to novice programmers. Experienced programmers learning new languages can also gain a lot of information about a given language's syntax and structure from a hello world program.

**Coordinates**

Cartesian Coordinates and Polar Coordinates

Cartesian Coordinates (i.e. a grid!)

Polar Coordinates!

**Graphical Programming**

-The following examples were all designed at MIT (over about 50 years), are intended as educational programming languages, and I've selected them as beginner-friendly

**LOGO**

![](http://home.messiah.edu/~deroos/csc171/LogoLab/LogoHelp/logosqr1.jpg)

*   an educational programming language designed by Seymour Papert at MIT in 1967
*   inspired by the [constructivist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(learning_theory)) theory that individual learners construct mental models to understand the world around them. However, constructionism holds that learning can happen most effectively when people are also active in making tangible objects in the real world. In this sense, constructionism is connected with experiential learning
*   [official](http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/logo/programming.html) website on MIT. There are a variety of versions of LOGO. THe most popular is called UCBLogo, designed at UCBerkeley.
*   1982 Logo [tutorial](http://applelogointroduction.wikispaces.com/home).

_-above example is written in TurtleArt, a simplified implementation of LOGO that looks like Scratch_

**Scratch**

*   originally developed at MIT's Lifelong Kindergarten group/MIT Media Lab in 2003
*   heavily influenced by constructionism and LOGO
*   The name was derived from the idea that DJs scratch and mix sounds, relating the ease of mixing sounds to the ease of mixing projects made with Scratch.
*   [official](https://scratch.mit.edu/) website to download Scratch also at MIT

**Processing**

*   created by Casey Reas and Ben Fry at MIT Media Lab in 2001
*   Processing is an open source programming language built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context, and to serve as the foundation for _electronic_ _sketchbooks_.

**Esoteric Programming Language**

An **esoteric programming language** is a programming language designed to test the boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, or as a joke. The use of esoteric distinguishes these languages from programming languages that working developers use to write software.

**Create a programming Language**

*   Draw a triangle inside of a circle inside of a square.
*   Create a programming language that can execute this, a computer language that allows you to describe the process that would create this drawing.
*   Describe how to draw it in a series of steps
*   These instructions could be graphical, text-based, music-based, physical or something else. There are a variety of ways of conveying information. Think of styles, syntax, and symbols. Start from a standpoint of rethinking computers and computation!
*   You should be able to create documentation for your language so that someone else could write in it and can execute your code to recreate our original drawing.
