Ideas of projects for Salem to look at:

*   [Wall Hanging Mood Ring ](http://itp.nyu.edu/~dbo3/roy/?p=565)- I’m proposing an implant or wearable that color codes the wearers emotional state.  This will give everyone complete transparency and provide ways for people to employ mood management theory and navigate the social world to find the experiences that would be the most beneficial for them.  It will also help them avoid those that wish to harm or are in a negative or different emotional state.  It has other benefits such as help those with developmental insufficiencies to ready emotional state such as children or those with autism. Once you have experienced a color on your own you will have achieved empathy with others who have obtained the same color level regardless of whether or not you have experienced the same specific event.  This will help bridge the gap between sympathy and true empathy. Of course this would be susceptible to tampering and manipulation, but it also provides self feedback for you to try to alter your emotional state. But it would be interesting to see signs saying “You Must Be This Calm to Enter” or “You Must Be This Vigilant to Leave”
*   [MindRider](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1168534473/mindrider-a-new-mind-mapping-helmet-system)_ - Originally developed at MIT_, MindRider is a new helmet system that shows, in real time, how your rides, movement, and location engage your mind. The MindRider app maps and tracks your engagement, and allows you to share your "mind-maps" with others. These maps provide quantified insight that empower you to maximize your riding experience, and they are a great resource for riding communities and street advocacy. 
*   [Sensory Fiction](http://scifi2scifab.media.mit.edu/2013/12/19/sensory-fiction/) - Traditionally, fiction creates and induces emotions and empathy through words and images. By using a combination of networked sensors and actuators, the Sensory Fiction author is provided with new means of conveying plot, mood, and emotion while still allowing space for the reader’s imagination. These tools can be wielded to create an immersive storytelling experience tailored to the reader. To explore this idea, we created a connected book and wearable. The ‘augmented’ book portrays the scenery and sets the mood, and the wearable allows the reader to experience the protagonist’s physiological emotions. The book cover animates to reflect the book’s changing atmosphere, while certain passages trigger vibration patterns.
*   [Meditation Mandala](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2013/12/11/mandalight-breath-controlled-meditation-lamp-wearablewednesday/) - Being a student in NYC can sometimes be stressful (especially during finals!). We needed to remind ourselves to breathe so we created a mediation mandala lamp that’s powered by breath. The wind sensor tracks exhales and inhales. We programmed the lamp to change colors with breath. The light changes colors as you inhale and exhale. Focusing on breathing (and not thinking about anything else) is a way to meditate. Even just a few minutes of focused breathing can have an amazing effect on your mood and can reduce anxiety.

STAN POKRAS 

"I consider myself to be a social engineer. I want to build systems and services that help people connect. I started down this path in 1970 by opening an information store front based on John Scully's "Everything for Everybody" in Manhattan. I sought out Scully after hearing the words "Whole Earth Catalog." I wanted to build a whole earth catalog of people. His business looked like an ideal way to start. For two years, my associates and I collected over 1500 "listings" (4 by 6 cards) of the things people wanted and had to offer. We listened to thousands more people as they called for help or stopped in to see us in our store."

or more of my history: I was one of the founding members of the Electronic Networking Association (ENA). As it's Vice President I ran a conference here in Philadelphia in 1988 which brought people from around the globe. Joi Ito, now Director of MIT's Media Lab, was a young hacker at the time and a founding member of the ENA. I don't think he was even in college when I met him.

I got involved with international networking because I was publishing a newsletter called "Other Networks." That got me an account on Delphi where I met people from EIES, at the NJIT. We used Harry Steven's software, Participate (Parti). It was most well known on "The Source" but we used it on a system called Unison out of Denver. I also looked in on conversations on the Well, but I didn't become a regular there.

"I recently re-read the book "Complexity, The Emerging Science at the Edge of Order and Chaos" by M. Mitchell Waldrop. It's the history of the Santa Fe Institute. This book encouraged me to vision my work building an Information Advocates Network as evolutionary. The book inspired me. It made me wish to write a paper (which I'm not qualified to write at this time) that I would like to title: Civic Consciousness: Increasing Self-Sufficiency in the Complex Adaptive City."

omg I didn't know you interviewed Stan! so funny - you know he was the original host of The Hacktory at NTR?

_Haven't talked to Stan yet but I certainly will! This is from his web page._

Here's a few links to things I mentioned at our meeting:

*   Salem, I saw this an thought it was in alignment with your project also -  a new project that monitors breathing allegedly to help track state of mind.  [](https://twitter.com/3lectromode/statuses/487730745847205889)https://twitter.com/3lectromode/statuses/487730745847205889

Also, do you know about efforts to map neighborhoods and identify "million-dollar blocks" which correlates to levels of incarceration?
